    <p>
    Matilda Wormwood is the main character from the novel
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_(novel)">Matilda</a>, written by Roald Dahl. This book has also been adapted into a movie. In this story, Matilda is a girl with very special powers- not only is she extremely smart (being able to calculate large numbers in her head on her own and learning to read all on her own), she can also make objects move without touching them!
