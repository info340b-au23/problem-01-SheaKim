    <p>
    Matilda Wormwood is the main character from the novel
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_(novel)">Matilda</a>, written by Roald Dahl. This book has also been adapted into a movie. In this story, Matilda is a girl with very special powers- not only is she extremely smart (being able to calculate large numbers in her head on her own and learning to read all on her own), she can also make objects move without touching them! 
  </p>
  
  <h2>Why I like this character:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>She is a voracious reader as a little girl and as a reader I can see myself in her because of that.</li>
    <li>She is very brave and not afraid to stand up for hersef and her values (even talking back to her father and her evil principal)</li>
    <li class = "best-reason">Despite being raised in an unsupportive home environment, Matilda grows and learns to not only be a very clever person, but also someone who is kind and stands up for the right things. I find this is one of her most admirable traits, and one that I would like to embody even though I have a stable and supportive family.</li>
  </ul>
